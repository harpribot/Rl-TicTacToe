Then Play, and try to defeat it. Thanks. I made this because there is absolutely zero codes on Tic Tac Toe using Q-learning implementation in matlab. I could find only few python codes that are painfully hard to decipher. They are not coder friendly and difficult to understand. Hope this implementation will be more easy to understand.
